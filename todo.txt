TODO
rename monero-project submodule to monero-project
add device and device_trezor after testing
in models, strings and pointers do not have to be boost::optional
preserve rpc error codes, just throwing runtime_error now
monero_wallet.cpp move utilities in monero_namespace to be private
polish model: remove all boost::optional from model to be consistent with monero-project?
ensure model toPropertyTrees(), etc are not unecessarily copying return objects
monero_wallet_listener should be a class?
way to use copy constructors instead of query copy(sp, sp) methods?
separate wallet default impl from must impl
create_tx and send_tx request arg should be const; need to copy
should not need wallet.h / wallet.cpp as dependency, why are GUI deps needed?
make model fields private and use accessors / mutators?
remove jstring2string, be consistent with other string inits
number of mining threads should be uint32_t instead of uint64_t
getReserveProofAccount() jni seg fault
sign/submit tx
nodeToTransferRequest(), etc need a final else catch-all
MoneroWallet getChainHeight() calling daemon connection every time, surely better way
toPropertyTree() should take node as parameter; optimize memory elsewhere (move shared_ptrs, etc)
enable debug logging
model accessors/mutators/chaining?
further automate build process

LOW PRIORITY
throw MoneroErrors with error codes instead of runtime_errors
handle e.g. restricted or hw wallet limitations in wallet_rpc_server, e.g. on_import_outputs?
